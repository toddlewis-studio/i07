# i07

### What to check out first

Start by looking at `www/script/app.js`

Then check out the home page
* `www/script/view/home.js`

Perhaps some 'components'
* `www/script/ui/bs.js` (This file has bootstrap shortcuts)
* `www/script/ui/nav.js` (The navbar of the website)



### Description

The purpose of i07 was to implement the elm MVU pattern into i0.

With the MVU (Model, View, Update) pattern, data is managed by the model and automatically updates the view when the data is changed. The user can then send messages via the update that may change the model, thus changing the view.

Its pretty swag, really.

I decided to use es6 for some unique function syntax. Thats where the swag really comes from. 

This was truly what the early versions of i0 looked like, but back then alot of phone browsers didn't support es6. 

Welcome to the future baby. Its i07.
